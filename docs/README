To make the documentation:
$ doxygen user_manual.conf
$ cd latex
$ make
$ acroread refman.pdf

or you can also type
$ doxygen reference_manual.conf

Here is some background on doxygen
    - http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/index.html
    - Run doxygen from: /usr/casc/hypre/warp/share/doxygen/bin/doxygen
    - The doxygen comments are to be placed in the header files.

    - A sample function declaration using the markdown approach
      to typesetting with equations is warp_Init() in warp.h
    - A sample structure is  _warp_Core_struct in _warp.h
    - Files can also be described as at the top of warp.h
    - The markdown rules are at http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/markdown.html

    - The tex document is setup as follows
        docs/local_doxygen.sty     is the style file
        docs/header.tex            is the title page
        docs/Introduction.md       is extra material that goes at the front of the PDF
        docs/user_manual.conf      only includes the user interface routines in warp.h
        docs/reference_manual.conf includes everything, and the kitchen sink
        docs/img                   contains the images
    
    - To regenerate generic doxygen latex files, type
      $ doxygen -w latex header.tex footer.tex doxygen.sty doxy.conf
      The .conf file must then be changed to use the new header file
      and to copy the local_doxygen.sty file to the latex directory.
